This is a Java program that sends commands over local network between two computers.
It stands for Network Commands Terminal.
It was done as a mini-project for the networking course at university.

The NCT consists of two main java programs: A sender and a Receiver, where the sender is the one responsible for establishing the connection and sending commands and the receiver acts as a server that receives and executes these commands. 

The "Matrix.bat" file contains the batch file that runs a cmd trick called the matrix effect, and the other two batch files compile and run the sender and receiver without having to manually compile them through cmd.

# Note
Although this project can definitely be updated and refactored, I decided to keep it as it is. It reminds me of my starting days, when I was passionate about doing stuff even with the limited knowledge I had.
